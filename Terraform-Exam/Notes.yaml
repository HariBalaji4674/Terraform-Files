extension: init.tpl or tftpl
address: ${consule_address}
placeholder: ${jsonencode}

What is Terragrunt:
  Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state.

What is Validation Block:
  Validation block is the code which make the users to provide values with certain constraints.
  It forces users to enter the values which they have mentioned th condition
Validation Block:
  varaible "som_var"{

Managing Multiple AWS Accoounts:
  By giving the assume role ,role_arn

Defining Multiple Regions:

  providers "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
    alias = "east_region"
  }
  provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west-1"
    alias = "west_region"
  }

Assigining Multiple Regions:
  data "aws_region" "west_region" {
    provider = aws.west_region
  }
  data "aws_region" "east_region"{
    provider = "east_region"
  }

Using Multiple Regions:
  resource "aws_instance" "west_region_instance" {
    provider = aws.west_region
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
  }

user_data_replace_on_change = true

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami  = ""
  instance_type = " "
  user_data = << -EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
    EOF
}
render a file from Module:
script = templatesfile("${path.module}/user-data.sh", { ... })
